## Compile and run
This project is written in Rust language and it is necessary that you have installed the Rust compiler first. Compile the source with the following command:

```
cargo build --release
```

And for run, copy from `.env.example` file and create `.env` file and configure variables. Then run the compiled binary and enjoy. Just make sure that the `.env` file and the binary file are together.
